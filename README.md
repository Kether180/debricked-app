The task - A simple dependency scanner

The task consists of creating a view that communicates (i.e. sends API calls) with our
vulnerability scan API. A user should be able to upload one or more dependency files (such
as yarn.lock and package-lock.json) at once, with possible errors dealt with gracefully.



Requirements

* Login feature 
● Send and receive data to our rest API
● The scan progress view should be reactive
● Vue.js
